# Regression-and-Classification

The assignment includes development of my own model and running multiple linear regression to check prediction accuracy. In the second part, I use logistic regression to explore the influence of various independent variables (e.g., dog's breed, age etc.) on the length of stay in the shelter. Finally, I provide insights from data analysis.
